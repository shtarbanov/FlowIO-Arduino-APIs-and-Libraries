2022.1.24
 - The latest board update causes the existing library to not compile due to stricter 
   requirements about the return values of function. The library has been updated to 
   have an extra line of code before the return statements on many functions.
 - Some simplifying changes have been made to getHardwareStateOf(Component name)
   TODO: Test if it still works as expected.
2021.12.23
- Renamed "_valveOpenedAt[]" to "_startTimes[]" in the .h and the Driver.

2021.12.24.1
- Previously, the "_startTimes[]" array was serving a double duty where in
  addition to holding the start times it also held information about whether
  a valve was already in an power optmized ON state. Now this secondary
  functionality has been dedicated to a boolean array named _powerOptimized[].
- The variable type of _startTimes[] array was changed from int to uint32_t
  because it no longer needs to hold a negative value.
- All of these changes were in the .h and Driver files only.

2021.12.24.2
- Added two more positions to the _startTimes[] array for the two pumps.
- Record the start times of the pumps into the array.
- Reset the start time of a pump to 0 when the pumps is stopped.
- All of these changes were in the .h and Driver files only.

2021.12.24.3
- Add the getter: uint32_t getStartTimeOf(Component name). If a component is
  currently active, this will return its starting time, else it will return 0.

2021.12.24.4
- Updates the keywords.txt to include all literals and functions defined till now.
- Add the inflateP() function definition in FeedbackControl.cpp.
- Add the inflatePcomplete flag in .h header.
- Put the time depended methods in FeedforwardControl.cpp
- Fixed a bug where inflateP() did not display the correct inflation time because I was
	reading the start time after the stopAction() function, which resets the start time to 0.
- Fixed an issue where the sensor does not work after reset button is pressed, by placing the
	activateSensor() function inside a while loop instead of an if block. Activation always
	fails the first time, and then succeeds the second time, hence why we need the while loop.
- Updated the Hardware Test example with the fix for sensor failure after reset.
- Updated all other examples with the fix for the sensor failure after reset.

2021.12.25.0
- added ports = ports & 0b00011111 to inflateP() so that comparison won't fail even if MSBs are not 000.
- If a user invokes inflateP(), while inflateP() is still running at a different port, ignore the attempt.
  This is done using the _inflatePrunning flag and comparing the status byte with the 'ports' argument
  each time the inflatP() function is invoked. Tested and confirmed.
- Fixed an issue where if I press the button to stop inflateP and then press it again to resume, it does
  not resume. his was fixed by resetting the _inflatePrunning flag to false at the beginning of inflateP
  if device is idle.


2021.12.25.1
- inflateP_diff -- allows you to specify different maximum pressures for different ports. Once the lowest
  specified pressure is reached, the corresponding port valve is closed but inflation continues until all
  other requested ports are at their specified pressures.



- TODO: Test with different pressure units like BAR
- TODO: releaseP() and vacuumP
- TODO: inflateT() nonblocking similar to inflateP().
- TODO: Add a global setPressureLimits() function to the library. You can call this function at the end of the main loop repeatedly to check if an ongoing action is at a limit and then stop it. But that would be
bad because a user may put a delay in his code and this function would not be reached on time. The function
should NOT be a repeatedly invoked function, but rather it should be invoked once, and it should act internally to the action functions. The action functions should themselves check if a pressure limit has been set, and if yes, they should monitor the pressure as they are performing an action. If a pressure limit
has not been set, then the action functions do not need to monitor the pressure. NOTE: The pressure limits
will only have an effect on the API functions, but NOT on the driver functions. Thus, a user can still exceed this limit if they choose to operate at the driver level. I can even have the pressure limit be added
as an optional argument to my action functions. In that way, I won't need to add a separate function for the
limit. And moreover, I won't even need the inflateP function in such a case. But no matter what method, the pressure monitoring should happend be happening once per main loop iteration at best. So if a user puts a
delay in his code, that would also delay the pressure monitoring. Unless we make the pressure monitor be
an interrupt that we can run on a fixed schedule without worrying about execution delays of user delays.

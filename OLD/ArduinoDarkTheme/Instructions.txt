Go to "ProgramFiles(86)/Arduino/lib" then replace the "theme" folder with the one from this directory. 
	(If the version has changed too much by the time you are reading this, what really matter inside the "theme" folder are "theme.txt" and "syntax/dark.xml". See what is inside theme.txt and then copy the lines from this file into the "theme.txt" of the arduino installation. 
	In the arduino installation folder, then go to "lib/theme/syntax" and change the name of "dark.xml" to "default.xml" after first deleting 
	the original default.xml that is already there.)

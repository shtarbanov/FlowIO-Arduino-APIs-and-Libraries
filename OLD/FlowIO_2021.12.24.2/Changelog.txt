- Renamed "_valveOpenedAt[]" to "_startTimes[]" in the .h and the Driver.

2021.12.24.1
- Previously, the "_startTimes[]" array was serving a double duty where in addition to holding
  the start times it also held information about whether a valve was already in an power optmized
  ON state. Now this second functionality has been dedicated a boolean array, _powerOptimized[].
- The variable type of _startTimes[] array was changed from int to uint32_t because it no longer
  needs to hold a negative value.
- All of these changes were in the .h and Driver files only.

2021.12.24.2
- Added two more positions to the _startTimes[] array for the two pumps.
- Record the start times of the pumps into the array.
- Reset the start time of a pump to 0 when the pumps is stopped.
- All of these changes were in the .h and Driver files only.
